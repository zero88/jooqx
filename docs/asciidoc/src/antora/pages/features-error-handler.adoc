= Error Handler

Basically, `exception` in execution time will be thrown by each particular `jdbc` driver or `reactive SQL driver`, it can be spaghetti code, dealing with `exception`, then `jooqx` is able to centralize any exception with properly
`SQL state` that thanks to `DataAccessException` in `jOOQ`.

It is easy to configure when building `executor`

== With JDBC SQL client

include::partial$features-error-handler.adoc[tag=jdbcErrorHandler]

== With JDBC PostgreSQL client

include::partial$features-error-handler.adoc[tag=pgErrorHandler]

== Integrating with your existing application exception

So more, you can integrate seamlessly with your existing application exception. For example:

include::partial$features-error-handler.adoc[tag=customError]

And then, when init `jooqx`, just register it

include::partial$features-error-handler.adoc[tag=integrateErrorHandler]
