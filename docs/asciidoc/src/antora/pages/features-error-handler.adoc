Basically, `exception` in execution time will be thrown by each particular `jdbc` driver or `reactive SQL driver`, it can be spaghetti code, dealing with `exception`, then `jooqx` is able to centralize any exception with properly
`SQL state` that thanks to `DataAccessException` in `jOOQ`.

It is easy to configure when building `executor`

include::partial$features-error-handler.adoc[tag=jdbcErrorHandler]

== With JDBC PostgreSQL client

include::partial$features-error-handler.adoc[tag=pgErrorHandler]
