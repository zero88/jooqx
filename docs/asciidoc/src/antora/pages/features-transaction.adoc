= SQL transaction

`jooqx` simplify supports `SQL transaction` by using `Pool` client (e.g: `JDBCPool`, `PgPool`, etc...) to borrows a connection from the pool, begins the transaction and releases the connection to the pool when the transaction ends.

== Session

The different between `transaction` and `session` is:

* `transaction` rollback if any error
* `session` still continue executing the sequence SQL statements regardless if any SQL statement has an error.
